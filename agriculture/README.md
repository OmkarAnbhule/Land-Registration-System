# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
These commands have to be followed

npm i 
npm run dev
npx nodemon index.cjs
npx hardhat node 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.cjs --network localhost
